# Tsukuyom1's Recipe App

## Project Description
Welcome to the Tsukuyom1's Recipe App! This application was developped in May 2021 during the Python course at Yandex.Lyceum to practice Flask development. It allows users to browse, create, and manage their favorite recipes.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**: the programming language used for backend development.
- **Flask**: a lightweight WSGI web application framework for building web applications.
- **SQLite**: a self-contained, serverless, and zero-configuration database engine used for storing recipe data.

## Installation

1. **Download the Code**: clone the repository or download the code as a ZIP file from the project repository.

2. **Install Requirements**: open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory. Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application**: after installing the requirements, you can start the application by executing:
